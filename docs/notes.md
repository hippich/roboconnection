### roboconnection notes

#### the JIBO namespace

see: *typings/index.d.ts[.x]* and *src/index.ts*

To ensure that the JIBO declarations are included in *dist/index.d.ts*, which is generated by `dts-bundle`, they are explicitly included in *src/index.ts*.

The `/// <reference path="../typings/index.d.ts" />` was being igonred by `dts-bundle`.
